# Movie Recommender System with Streamlit

This project implements a movie recommender system using Streamlit, leveraging machine learning techniques to recommend movies based on user selection.

## Overview

The Movie Recommender System allows users to:
- Select a movie from a dropdown menu or by typing its name.
- Receive recommendations of similar movies based on precomputed similarity scores.
- View recommended movies along with their posters fetched from The Movie Database (TMDb) API.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preparation and Model Training:**
   - The system is pre-trained with a dataset containing movie titles, genres, plot summaries, and user ratings.
   - A machine learning model computes similarity scores between movies based on these features.

2. **Recommendation Process:**
   - When a user selects a movie, the system retrieves precomputed similarity scores to find similar movies.
   - It fetches movie posters using real-time API calls to TMDb for visual appeal.

3. **User Interface:**
   - Users interact with the system through a Streamlit web interface.
   - They select a movie from a dropdown menu and click "Recommend" to receive movie suggestions.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
